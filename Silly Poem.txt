The Color Blue

Many are happy and yellow 
some don't have clue and are blue

People search for the clue
going from ruse to ruse,
shoe to shoe 

They never realize that the color blue could be a lighter hue.
Always associated with sadness why is it?
when beautiful waves are the color and so were the uniforms of our founding fathers.
Never quite thought about that have you?

Why is yellow so happy when it's the color of bees' and 
snakes, things that surely do pack a hard hit.

We may never understand it
but that's not my problem,
I'm just glad I am not as confused as blue
oh boo who.
